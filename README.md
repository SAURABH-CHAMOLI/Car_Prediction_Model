# Car Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project is a machine learning application designed to predict car prices based on various features. The model is built using a Random Forest algorithm and is trained on a dataset containing information such as car name, year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type. The goal is to provide an accurate estimation of car prices to assist users in making informed decisions.

## Key Features

- **Predict Car Prices**: Estimate the price of a car based on input features.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes feature scaling and encoding to prepare the data for prediction.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Users can input car details through a web form and receive price predictions.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Render, a cloud platform that simplifies the deployment and hosting of web applications. You can access the live application at the following link:
